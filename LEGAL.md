#The legal bits

This is a fork of [this](https://github.com/juliandoucette/grunt-markdown-site) project. I use a lot of the same code. Please look at git diffs to see code changes I have made.

For the original, markdown version of this project, please give credit to [Julian Doucette](https://github.com/juliandoucette).

If I understand correctly, this needs to be re-distributed under the same licence as the original project: LGPL-3.0. The original Licence document is included in the root of this repository.
